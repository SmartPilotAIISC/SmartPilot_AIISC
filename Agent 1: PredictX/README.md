# Repository for PredictX:Neurosymbolic Multimodal Hybrid Fusion for Robust and Interpretable Anomaly Prediction in Assembly Pipelines
This repository contains curated datasets, implementation of methods experimented and introduced in the "PredictX" agent of SmartPilot.

# 1. Data Preprocessing #

This folder contains the codes used to extract the analog and multimodal datasets which was created from the Future Factories(FF) Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramyharik/ff-2023-12-12-analog-dataset)

The final preprocessed multimodal dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l7_Blmk_RrsLHqcW_4F7-ELtll_ZGyDv?usp=sharing


The final preprocessed analog dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v-UyJqlZMG68Mwd2Gict9E885MS023iR?usp=sharing
