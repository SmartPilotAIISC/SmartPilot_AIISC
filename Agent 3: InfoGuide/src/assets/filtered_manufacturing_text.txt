quoted for your information and guidance.
Responsibility for Safeguarding (ISO10218)
When designing a robot system in which an operator and a robot 
collaborate in the environment of no safeguarding, sufficient risk 
assessment should be carried out to avoid damages to the equipment or 
unexpected injury to the operator or people around the system during the 
operation.
3.2
Mounting Procedures for Manipulator Base
The manipulator should be firmly mounted on a baseplate or foundation 
strong enough to support the manipulator and withstand reaction forces 
during acceleration and deceleration.
Construct a solid foundation with the appropriate thickness to withstand 
maximum reaction forces of the manipulator referring to table 3-1  
“Manipulator Reaction Force and Torque” .

General Information
• The stopping distance is an angle traveled by the manipulator from 
the moment when the stop signal is activated until the manipulator 
comes to a complete standstill.
• The stopping time is a time elapsed from the moment that the stop 
signal is activated until the manipulator comes to a complete stand-
still.
• The data that are given for the main axes S, L and U are the maxi-
mum displacement.
• Superposed axes motions may result in longer stopping distance.
• Stopping distance and stopping time are measured in accordance 
with ISO 10218-1, Annex B
• Stop categories: According to IEC60204-1
• Stop category 0
• Stop category 1
• The values specified for Stop category 0 are the reference values 
that are determined by tests and simulations.  The actual stopping 
distance and stopping time may differ.

screws M5 (length: 14 mm) (two screws) (three places) with using the 
tightening torque 6 Nm (tensile strength: 1200 N/mm2 or more), mount 
the HW1306535-1 and HW1306535-2 (two stoppers) with four hexagon 
socket head cap screws M5 (length: 20 mm) (two screws) 
(two places) with using the tightening torque 6 Nm (tensile strength: 
1200 N/mm2 or more) to the base.
When the motion range is ±180° (standard), mounting the stopper is not 
required.
S-axis mechanical stopper can be set at 15° pitch intervals from ± 0° to 
165° range.
For the settable angles, refer to table 5-3  “The Settable Angle for S-Axis 
Stopper” .

Allowable Load for Wrist Axis and Wrist Flange
6.1
Allowable Wrist Load
The allowable payload of the wrist axis is 10 kg.  However, the 
requirements listed in table 6-1  “Allowable Wrist Load”  must be satisfied 
regarding the moment and the inertia. 
Even if the load is not applied as mass but applied as force, the values in 
table 6-1 must not be exceeded. 
When the volume of the load is relatively small, refer to the moment arm 
rating (LB, LT) shown in fig. 6-1  “Moment Arm Rating” . 
Each value of the allowable inertia above is calculated assuming that the 
moment load is at the maximum.  Thus, in the case when only the inertia 
load is applied, when the moment load is small while the inertia load is 
large, or when the load is not applied as mass but applied as force, etc., 
contact your YASKAWA representative in advance.

Soft Cover for Covering the Manipulator (Optional)
The soft cover for covering the manipulator is optional.
For the mounting position of the soft cover, refer to fig. 7-5  “Mounting 
Position of the Soft Cover” .

Notes when mounting the soft cover
Mount the soft cover properly by following the notes below to avoid it from 
being damaged (wear) or coming off.
• Mount the soft cover correctly so that the corner deviation may not 
occur. 
• The soft cover is made of elastic material.  Be careful not to strain 
excessively.
• Do not cover the entire joint part for preventing interference.
Fig. 7-5: Mounting Position of the Soft Cover

Notes when using a soft cover
When the soft cover is mounted, the temperature of the manipulator’s 
components rises easily.  Therefore, the limitation of the ambient 
temperature for installation is set below the standard temperature for the 
purpose of protecting the manipulator.

Inspection Schedule
Proper inspections are essential not only to assure that the mechanism 
will be able to function for a long period, but also to prevent malfunctions 
and assure safe operation.  Inspection intervals are classified into six 
levels as shown in table 9-1  “Inspection Items” .
In table 9-1, the inspection items are categorized by types of operations: 
operations which can be performed by personnel authorized by the user, 
operations to be performed by trained personnel, and operations to be 
performed by service company personnel.  Only specified personnel shall 
perform the inspection work.
DANGER
•
Do not remove the motor, and do not release the brake.
Failure to observe this caution may result in death or serious injury from 
unexpected turning of the manipulator's arm. 
WARNING
•
Maintenance and inspection must be performed by specified 
personnel.
Failure to observe this caution may result in electric shock or injury.
•
For disassembly or repair, contact your YASKAWA representative.
•
Before maintenance or inspection, be sure to turn the main power 
supply OFF, and put up a warning sign.  (ex. DO NOT TURN THE 
POWER ON.)
Failure to observe this warning may result in electric shock or injury.
NOTICE
•
The battery pack must be connected before removing detection 
connector when maintenance and inspection.
Failure to observe this caution may result in the loss of home position 
data.
NOTE
• The inspection interval must be based on the servo power 
supply on time.
• The following inspection schedule is based on the case 
where the manipulator is used for the cooperation with the 
working people.  If the manipulator is used for other appli-
cation or if it is used under special conditions, a case-by-
case examination is required. 
The inspection may be conducted at shorter intervals if the 
manipulator is used very frequently for the application 
such as handling, in this case, contact your YASKAWA 
representative.

Due to the operating conditions or the ambient environment, the oil may seep from the lip part of the oil seal and adhere to the outside of the lip part. 
The seeped oil may accumulate and fall in drops depending on the operation.  Before the operation, clean the oil in the lower side of the oil seal of sliding parts to prevent
the seeped oil from accumulating.  Frequent reverse motions or operations under a high-temperature environment may lead to a high temperature of the motor and the
oil may seep due to a rise in the internal pressure of the grease bath. 
In that case, release the grease inlet immediately after completing the operation to lower the internal pressure. 
(When releasing the grease inlet, ensure that grease does not scatter. )

Secure Water Treatment Dataset

Cyber Physical Systems(CPSs) are built by integrating computational algorithms and physical components for various mission-critical tasks. Examples of such systems include public infrastructures such as smart power grids, water treatment and distribution networks, transportation, robotics and autonomous vehicles. These systems are typically large and geographically dispersed, hence they are being network connected for remote monitoring and control. However, such network connectivities open up the likelihood of cyber attacks. Such possibilities make it necessary to develop techniques to defend CPSs against attacks: cyber or physical. A“cyber attack” refers to an attack that is transmitted through a communications network to affect system behavior with an intention to cause some economic harm. A “physical attack” is on a physical component such as a motor or a pump to disrupt state of the system.
Research efforts in securing CPSs from such attacks have been ongoing. However, there is limited availability of operational data sets in this research community to advance the field of securing CPSs. While there are datasets for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), these datasets focus primarily on network traffic. Such datasets include, for example, the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset[3] and the NSL-KDD99[2] datasets. These data are a collection of RAW TCP dump collected over a period of time which includes various intrusions simulated in a military network environment. Such datasets are thus not suitable for CPS IDS. The only other publicly available datasets for CPS kown to the authors are provided by the Critical Infrastructure Protector Center at the Mississippi State University (MSU) [4]. Their datasets[4] comprise of data obtained from their Power, Gas and Water testbeds. The power dataset is based on a simulated smart grid whereas their water and gas datasets were obtained from a very small scale laboratory testbed. However, as acknowledged by the authors themselves, these datasets have been found to contain some unintended patterns that can be used to easily identify attacks versus non-attacks using machine learning algorithms. Although the gas dataset was updated in 2015[4] to provide more randomness, it was obtained from a small scale testbed which may not reflect the true complexity of CPSs. Hence, there is no publicly available realistic dataset of a sufficient complexity from a modern CPS that contains both network traffic data and physical properties of the CPS.
The goal of this paper is to provide a realistic dataset that can be utilised to design and evaluate CPS defence mechanisms. In this paper, we present a dataset obtained from Secure Water Treatment testbed (SWaT).

, SwaT is a fully operational scaled down water treatment plant with a small footprint, producing 5 gallons/minute of doubly filtered water. This testbed replicates large modern plants for water treatment such as those found in cities. Its main purpose is to enable experimentally validated research in the design of secure and safe CPS. SWaT has six main processes corresponding to the physical and control components of the water treatment facility.

Water treatment process
The process (P1) begins by taking in raw water and storing it in a tank. It is then passed through the pre-treatment process (P2). In this process, the quality of the water is assessed. Chemical dosing is performed if the water quality is not within acceptable limits. The water than reaches P3 where undesirable materials are removed using fine filtration membranes. After the residuals are filtered through the Ultra Filtration system, any remaining chorine is destroyed in the Dechlorination process (P4) using Ultraviolet lamps. Subsequently, the water from P4 is pumped into the Reverse Osmosis (RO) system (P5) to reduce inorganic impurities. In the last process, P6, water from the RO is stored and ready for distribution in a water distribution system. In the case of SWaT, the treated water can be transferred back to the raw tank for re-processing. However, for the purpose of data collection, the water from P6 is disposed to mimic water distribution.
	2.2	Communications
SWaT consists of a layered communication network, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) workstation, and a Historian. Data from the sensors is available to the SCADA system and recorded by the Historian for subsequent analysis.
As illustrated in Figure3, there are two networks in SWaT. Level 1 is a star network that allows the SCADA system to communicate with the six PLCs dedicated to each of the process. Level 0 is a ring network that transmits sensor and actuator data to the relevant PLC. The sensors, actuators and PLCs all communicate either via wired or wireless links (where manual switches allow the switch between wireless and wired modes).


3	Attack Scenarios
A systematic approach was used to attack the system. We used the attack model[1] that considers the intent space of an attacker for a given CPS in the attack model. This attack model can be used to generate attack procedures and functions that target a specific CPS. In our case, the attack model to target the SWaT testbed was derived. We assumed that an attacker succeeds in launching an attack. We assume that an attacker is successful in launching an attack, hence the number of possible attack scenarios is infinite.
The attack model[1] for CPS is abstracted as a sextuple (M; G; D; P; S0; Se), where M is potentially an infinite set of procedures to launch attacks, G is a subset of a finite set of attacker intents, D is the domain model for the attacks derived from the CPS, P is a finite set of attack points, and S0 and Se are infinite sets of states of CPS, that denote, respectively, the possible start and end states of interest to the attacker. An attack point in CPS could be a physical element or an entry point through the communications network connecting sensors or actuators to the controllers (PLCs) and the SCADA system.
From the above discussion, it is clear that the space of potential attacks is large. The massive size of the attack space arises by changing the method M, potential attack points, P, as well as the start and end state of the CPS. SWaT consists of six stages where each stage contains different number of sensors and actuators. Based on attack points in each stage, the attacks are divided into four types.
1.	Single Stage Single Point (SSSP): A Single Stage Single Point attack focuseson exactly one point in a CPS.
2.	Single Stage Multi Point (SSMP): A Single Stage Multiple Point attackfocuses on two or more attack points in a CPS but on only one stage. In this case set, P consists of more than one element in a CPS selected from any one stage.
3.	Multi Stage Single Point (MSSP): A Multi Stage Single Point attack is similar to an SSMP attack except that now the SSMP attack is performed on multiple stages.
4.	Multi Stage Multi Point (MSMP): A Multi Stage Multi Point attack is anSSMP attack performed two or more stages of the CPS.
For a detailed description of the attacks generated, we refer the reader to the dataset website . The data collection process consisted of the following steps. Step 1: Define each attack based on the number of attack points and places. Step 2: Design each attack based on the attack point (i.e. the actuator or sensor to be affected affect), start state, type of attack, the value of the selected sensor data to be sent to the PLC, the intended impact.
A total of 36 attacks were launched during the data collection process. The breakdown of these attacks are listed in Table1. The duration of the attack is varied based on the attack type. A few attacks, each lasting ten minutes, are performed consecutively with a gap of 10minutes between successive attacks. Some of the attacks are performed by letting the system stabilize before a subsequent attack. The duration of system stabilization varies across attacks. Some of the attacks have a stronger effect on the dynamics of system and causing more time for the system to stabilize. Simpler attacks, such as those that effect flow rates, require less time to stabilize. Also, some attacks do not take effect immediately.

	4	Data collection process
The data collection process lasted for a total of 11 days. SWaT was functioning non-stop 24 hours/day, during the entire 11-day period. SWaT was run without any attacks during the first seven of the 11-days. Attacks were launched during the remaining four days. Various attack scenarios, discussed in Section3, were implemented on the testbed. These attacks were of various intents and lasted between a few minutes to an hour. Depending on the attack scenario, the system was either allowed to reach its normal operating state before another attack was launched or the attacks were launched consecutively.
The following assumptions ere made during the data collection process.
1.	The system will stabilise and reach its operation state within the first sevendays of normal operation.
2.	Data is recorded once every second assuming that no significant attack onthe SWaT testbed can be launched in less than one second.
3.	The PLC firmware does not change.
All tanks in SWaT were emptied prior to starting data collection; i.e. the data collection process starts from an empty state of SWaT. This initialization was deemed necessary to ensure that all the tanks are filled with unfiltered water and not pre-treated.
	4.1	Physical Properties
All the data was logged continuously once every second into a Historian server. Data recorded in the Historian was obtained from the sensors and actuators of the testbed. Sensors are devices that convert a physical parameter into an electronic output, i.e. an electronic value whereas actuators are devices that convert a signal into a physical output, i.e. turning the pump off or on.
The dataset describes the physical properties of the testbed in operational mode. In total, 946,722 samples comprising of 51 attributes were collected over 11 days. Data capturing the physical properties can be used for profiling cyberattacks. Table2 describes the different sensors and actuators in SWaT that served as source of the data.
As the data collection process started from an empty state, it tool about about 5 hours for SWaT to stablise. Figure4(a) indicates a steady flow of water into the tank in P1 (the level of tank is reported by sensor LIT101). Figure4(b) shows that it took approximately 5 hours for the tank to fill up and reach its operational state. For the tanks in stages P3 and P4 (level of tank reported by sensor LIT301 and LIT401 respectively), it took approximately 6 hours for the tanks to be filled up. This is because the water from P1 is sent to P2 for chemical dosing before it reaches P3, hence an additional hour is needed to fill up the tank. The water from P3 is subsequently sent to P4 for reverse osmosis.
Figures5(a) and5(b) illustrate consequences of cyber attacks. Figure5(a) illustrates a disturbance in the usual cycle of the reading from sensor LIT101 during 6:30 pm and 6:42 pm This was an SSSP attack with the intention of overflowing the tank by shutting pump P101 off and manipulating the value of LIT101 to be at 700mm for 12 minutes. The effects are immediately observed over the next hour before the data stabilised nearly two hours later. Similarly Figure5(b) shows the consequence of an SSSP attack with the intention to underflow the tank and damage pump P101. In this attack sensor LIT-301 was attacked between 12.08pm and 12.15pm to increase the sensor level to 1100mm. This deceives the PLC to think that there is an over supply of water and turns the pump on to supply water to P4. In reality, the water level falls below the low mark while the pump is still active. Given sufficient time, this attack can cause the tank in P3 to underflow t, thus stagnating the output of the plant and damaging the pumps.
	4.2	Network Traffic
Network traffic was collected using commercially available equipment from Check Point R Software Technologies Ltd . This equipment was installed in the SWaT testbed. The use case of the equipment was specifically to collect all the network traffic for analysis. However, for the purpose of data collection, we retrieved
